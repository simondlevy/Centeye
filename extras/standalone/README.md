This folder contains an example of how to use the ImageUtils and OpticalFlow libraries with OpenCV and an ordinary webcam.
After building the <b>asciicap</b> program, you can run it to see an ASCII display of the image being captured
by the camera. Make sure to resize your terminal window for maximal display quality.
